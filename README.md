### **3. Tax Calculation Logic**

#### **Old Regime Calculation Logic**:
1. **Input Values**:
   - **Gross Income**
   - **Other Deductions** (from input)
   - Apply **Standard Deduction** of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals.
   - Subtract **deductions** (Section 80C, 80D, etc.) — except for what is combined under "Other Deductions."

2. **Net Taxable Income**:
   - `Net Taxable Income = Gross Income - Other Deductions - ₹50,000 (Standard Deduction)`

3. **Apply Tax Slabs**:
   - For income **up to ₹2.5 Lakh**: No tax
   - For **₹2,50,001 to ₹5 Lakh**: 5%
   - For **₹5,00,001 to ₹10 Lakh**: 20%
   - For **Above ₹10 Lakh**: 30%

4. **Health & Education Cess**:
   - Add **4% cess** on total tax payable.

5. **Section 87A Rebate** (if applicable):
   - If **taxable income** is **less than ₹5 Lakh**, provide **₹12,500 rebate**.

6. **Surcharge** (if applicable):
   - If **income** exceeds ₹50 Lakh, apply surcharge:
     - 10% on tax if income is between ₹50 Lakh to ₹1 Cr.
     - 15% on tax if income is between ₹1 Cr to ₹2 Cr.
     - 25% on tax if income is between ₹2 Cr to ₹5 Cr.
     - 37% on tax if income exceeds ₹5 Cr.

7. **Output**:
   - Show **final tax payable** after applying cess, rebate, and surcharge.

#### **New Regime Calculation Logic**:
1. **Input Values**:
   - **Gross Income**
   - **Other Deductions** (only certain allowed deductions like EPF, NPS)

2. **Net Taxable Income**:
   - `Net Taxable Income = Gross Income - Other Deductions`

3. **Apply Tax Slabs**:
   - For income **up to ₹2.5 Lakh**: No tax
   - For **₹2,50,001 to ₹5 Lakh**: 5%
   - For **₹5,00,001 to ₹7.5 Lakh**: 10%
   - For **₹7,50,001 to ₹10 Lakh**: 15%
   - For **₹10,00,001 to ₹12.5 Lakh**: 20%
   - For **₹12,50,001 to ₹15 Lakh**: 25%
   - For **Above ₹15 Lakh**: 30%

4. **Health & Education Cess**:
   - Add **4% cess** on total tax payable.

5. **Section 87A Rebate** (if applicable):
   - If **taxable income** is **less than ₹5 Lakh**, provide **₹12,500 rebate**.

6. **Surcharge** (if applicable):
   - Apply surcharge based on income as mentioned above.

7. **Output**:
   - Show **final tax payable** after applying cess, rebate, and surcharge.

### **4. Edge Case Handling**
- **Senior Citizens** (aged 60+):
  - No tax for income up to ₹3 Lakh in **Old Regime**.
  - No tax for income up to ₹3 Lakh in **New Regime** (though no standard deduction or HRA in the new regime).
  
- **Super Senior Citizens** (aged 80+):
  - No tax for income up to ₹5 Lakh in **Old Regime**.
  - No tax for income up to ₹5 Lakh in **New Regime**.
  
- **Income from Other Sources**:
  - If applicable, consider as part of **Gross Income**.

### **5. Technical Implementation**  

#### **Data Validation Rules**:
- **Input Validations** (using Zod):
  - **Gross Income**: 
    - Must be greater than 0
    - Required field
  - **HRA Received**:
    - Must be greater than or equal to 0
    - Cannot exceed gross income
  - **Rent Paid**:
    - Must be greater than or equal to 0
  - **Home Loan Interest**:
    - Must be greater than or equal to 0
  - **Deductions (80C, 80D, 80CCD1B)**:
    - Must be greater than or equal to 0
    - Cannot exceed their respective maximum limits
    - 80C: Max ₹1.5 Lakh
    - 80D: Max ₹1 Lakh
    - 80CCD1B: Max ₹50,000

#### **Frontend (UI)**:
- Use a framework like **React.js** or **Vue.js** to create the input form and results display.
- Provide clear labels and explanations for input fields.
- Display **real-time results** as the user enters values, or after they click "Calculate."

#### **Backend (Optional)**:
- Use **Node.js** or **Python Flask/Django** to handle the tax calculation logic.
- Ensure API endpoints for both regimes to return the calculated tax based on user input.

#### **Database** (Optional):
- Store common data like tax slabs, surcharge percentages, and health & education cess.
- Store user inputs for future reference (if desired).

#### **Testing**:
- Write **unit tests** for tax calculation logic (both old and new regimes).
- Create edge case tests for senior citizens, income from multiple sources, and rebate scenarios.
- Test for correct handling of surcharge, cess, and deductions.

#### **Error Handling**:
- Display validation errors inline with input fields
- Show appropriate error messages for:
  - Negative values
  - Zero gross income
  - Deductions exceeding maximum limits
  - HRA exceeding gross income
- Prevent form submission until all validation rules are satisfied

  - Let users download a summary or report of their tax calculations.

- **Interactive UI**:
  - Provide a calculator with **tooltips** and **explanatory texts** on tax slabs, rebates, and deductions.
